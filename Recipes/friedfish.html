    <div>
        <p>Any kind of fried fish is easy to cook. I’m sure that we all have our own ways of frying fish. I am sharing this recipe post just so you know how I do it. There is nothing special in my method. In fact, most of you might be doing the same thing.

        <p>I love fried fish. This is something that I can eat everyday. However, I try to refrain making this during the winter months because the smell of the fish lingers in the house for a while. In the Philippines, I can do this everyday. I remember just opening all the windows and the smell just disappears after a few hours.</p>

    <b>Ingredients:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pieces tilapia <i>cleaned and scales removed</i></li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 cup cooking oil</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Steps:</b>
    <ol>
        <li>Rub salt all over the fish including the insides.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a wide frying pan.</li>
        <li>When the oil is hot, put-in the tilapia. Cover the frying pan, but make sure to open it a little so that steam can come out. Fry each side in medium heat for about 6 to 10 minutes. Note: I usually wait until I don’t hear any sound. This means that the liquid is gone and the fish is crisp.</li>
        <li>Remove from the pan and arrange in a serving plate.</li>
        <li>Serve with your favorite condiments and side dish.</li>
        <li>Share and enjoy!</li>
