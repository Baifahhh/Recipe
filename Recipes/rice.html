    <h3>Learn how to cook rice!</h3>
    <div>
        <p>Rumor has it that you need a rice cooker or an Instant pot to cook fluffy, tender rice at home. Well, I’m here to tell you that the rumors aren’t true. Cooking rice on the stove is quick and easy, and if you do it the right way, it works every time. Below, I’m sharing 2 foolproof stovetop methods for how to cook rice in under 30 minutes. Without fail, the rice comes out light, fluffy, and not at all gummy. So skip the fancy gadgets, and grab a saucepan with a lid! A steaming pot of perfect rice is just half an hour away.</p>

    <b>Ingredients:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Steps:</b>
    <ol>
        <li><b>First, rinse the rice.</b> Do not skip this step! It washes away starches that will cause the rice to clump together, so it’s key for cooking soft, fluffy rice. Add the rice to a fine mesh strainer set over a large bowl, and rinse until the water in the bowl runs clear.</li>
        <li><b>Then, measure the proper water to rice ratio.</b> Measure 1 1/2 cups of water and 1 teaspoon olive oil for every cup of uncooked rice. (1 cup dry rice yields about 3 cups cooked.) Combine the rice, oil, and water in a medium saucepan, and stir to combine. Bring to a boil over high heat</li>
        <li><b>Next, simmer.</b> When the water starts boiling, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and reduce the heat to low. Simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li><b>Finally, let it steam.</b> Turn off the heat and let the pot stand, covered, for 10 minutes. Remove the lid and fluff the rice with a fork. That’s it!</li>
